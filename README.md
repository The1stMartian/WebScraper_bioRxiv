# bioRxiv_scraper
Python-selenium web scraper for bioRxiv publication data

The bioRxiv scraper will collect data on every manuscript in the bioRxiv database using Selenium. Data include author and title information, the number of views by type, and the number of Tweets a paper has received. Additional scraping features could certainly be added including other social media mentions.
